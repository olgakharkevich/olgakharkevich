## Hi, I’m Olga 👋

🔭 I’m currently working as a volunteer front-end developer on **mlflow-oidc-auth**, an open-source plugin that adds enterprise-grade OIDC authentication and authorization to MLflow Tracking Server, including a modern React SPA admin UI.

🌱 I’m currently learning modern React best practices (architecture, state management, testing) and how to use AI tools effectively in day-to-day front-end development.

👯 I’m looking to collaborate on front-end projects that use React, TypeScript, Redux Toolkit, Tailwind CSS, and REST APIs – especially complex SPAs, dashboards, or eCommerce UIs.

🤔 I’m looking for help with growing into paid front-end roles in the Greater Toronto Area and joining funded open‑source initiatives where I can contribute on the UI side.

💬 Ask me about explaining complex concepts in simple language (if I understand it and you want to understand it, we will get there together). I'm also happy to chat about my work on the mlflow-oidc-auth UI and workflows.

⚡ Fun fact: I enjoy singing in an a cappella women’s choir, playing guitar, and making homemade zefir and marshmallows. You can also find some of this side of me on Instagram: [@olga.kharkevich](https://www.instagram.com/olga.kharkevich/)
